"__label__3.0 we still know very little about pearson compared to most yearold pitching prospects he popped up seemingly out of nowhere as a sophomore at a lesser florida junior college but quickly entered the first round discussion when juco ball kicked off in january of  as the draft approached pearson was showing better secondary stuff in games and bumping  mph in bullpen sessions for scouts he forced his way up draft boards even though teams had little history with him and some were skeptical of the new velocity or concerned it would lead to injury 
pearson made seven short but dominant appearances in the northwest league during the summer and was poised to begin  at hia dunedin an aggressive assignment but he suffered an intercostal strain and began the season on the dl in his final extended spring rehab start he was sitting  and touching  with the fastball he finally toed a florida state league rubber that week and lasted  innings before a comebacker struck his wrist and forearm and fractured his ulna the injury ended his regular season after just five outs 
after rest and some rehab during instructs pearson went to arizona for the fall league his stuff was electric there his fastball always sitting  and cresting  mph often he threw a  mph fastball and a  mph slider during the fall stars game and he was able to dump his uppers curveball in for strikes throughout his sixweek tenure though he threw no changeups pearson was also horribly wild at times its fair to conclude that rust was to blame for his occasional wildness but because the pro side of the industry has seen so little of pearson its impossible to know for sure 
theres a strong possibility that he just ends up in the bullpen but if he does and he breathes oneinning fire like he did during fall stars he basically has aroldis chapmans stuff though perhaps not the same extension or approach angle provided he stays healthy pearsons future is bright albeit unclear hes likely to be handled with care for a while in order to keep him healthy and manage his workload after what was essentially a lost  but given the wide variance and top shelf stuff there is still frontline starter potential"

theres a strong possibility that he just ends up in the bullpen but if he does and he breathes oneinning fire like he did during fall stars he basically has aroldis chapmans stuff though perhaps not the same extension or approach angle provided he stays healthy pearsons future is bright albeit unclear hes likely to be handled with care for a while in order to keep him healthy and manage his workload after what was essentially a lost  but given the wide variance and top shelf stuff there is still frontline starter potential"

crouses repertoire depth is not the issue based on his pitch usage during instructional league his changeup seemed to be a developmental priority and he has indeed made progress with it it now comfortably projects to average while crouses fastballbreaking ball combination has been excellent since he was a high school underclassman  he incorporates all kinds of crafty veteran wrinkles into his deliverys cadence on occassion an extra shoulder wiggle a travoltaian gyration of the hips the occasional quickpitch  all sorts of things designed to take hitters by surprise scouts often sentence quirky visibly fiery and emotional hurlers to lateinning duty and we do think crouse would thrive in such a role but view these traits as positives crouse has a unique build and delivery and is a very short strider whose foot extension sucks some of the perceived velo out of his fastball this plus the lower slot might make him unusually vulnerable to lefties despite his velocity this his brief injury history and still fringy command all contribute to a bundle of relief risk in our opinion"

__label__3.0 teams were understandably late to identify howard as an upper crust draft prospect he redshirted then only threw  innings the following spring as a redshirt freshman and began his draft year in the bullpen a relative unknown he moved to the rotation in march and crosscheckers started showing up to see him much later than is typical for a first look at a second round talent in  his first full season as a member of the rotation howard thrived and late in the year his stuff took off after two dominant months to close his regular season howard threw a no hitter in the sally league playoffs during that stretch he was sitting  for much of his starts and flashing three good secondary pitches the best of which is a disappearing lows changeup howard can also freeze hitters with a mids curveball and use it to get ahead and his mids slider has enough length to miss bats away from righties though he has below average fastball command howards ability to throw his breaking balls for strikes significantly improves his chances of starting his inning count in   was about the same as it was if you combine his college and pro workload from  and its fair to assume that even if philly wants to him to throw more innings an innings cap might impede a  debut even if howards stuff is ready he has considerable upside if he can retain his stuff while carrying a plus inning burden
__label__2.0 in front of a huge contingent of scouts jameson carved up stanford in his first start of the  season and was immediately on the map as a drafteligible sophomore his highmaintenance delivery is hard to repeat but it also makes things awkward for hitters who dont typically see this kind of arm slotrelease point and from that release point emerges nasty stuff jameson will touch  he manipulates the shape of two good breaking balls and hell flash an occasional plus changeup the delivery may make it hard for him to start and jameson has a skinny atypical frame some teams think he ends up in relief but it may be a multiinning or highleverage role
__label__1.0 avelino has no idea where most of his pitches are going he has  walks in  career innings but he has big time arm strength for his age  and several other fastball traits that could make the offering dominant if he ever becomes a passable strikethrower the chahnces of that seem low considering how much avelino has struggled with it ot this point but he has notable velocity spin and spin tilt so he should be on the radar
__label__1.0 then with minnesota palacios got red hot during the early part of  and looked like he might be turning a corner teams saw him as multipositional infielder with good feel for contact but were forced to revisit that evaluation when palacios had a long stretch during which he was also hitting for power he was promoted his performance regressed and he was traded to tampa bay for jake odorizzi just before the  season then the upper levels of the minors took advantage of palacios epicurean pitch selection as his numbers continued to decline in  and  forcing a move to the mound late in the summer he has been into the mids
__label__3.0 medina is right there with sanchez in the phillies system when it comes to upside he shows three plus pitches at times and may be a better athlete than sanchez so the elements of frontline starter potential are here medina works in the mids early in games with plus life and at his best hell pair it with a changeup with similar action and a slider that can play even better than  when ideally used and located like most young power arms medinas command and velocity degrade in the middle innings as his focus and intensity wane and fatigue starts to set in more advanced hitters can lay off his lively stuff when its more areatype control than mlblevel pitch execution scouts like medinas makeup coachability and athleticism most prefer him to sanchez in this regard and expect him to continue to improve in these areas

the two issues for kowar are his very short stride which causes his velocity to play down and his breaking ball which is not great its still most often a below average pitch with curveball velocity and threequarters slider shape cogent pitch design may help the pitch or indicate the royals should just scrap it altogether and try something like a cutter or slider these issues are almost identical to luke weavers coming out of florida state hes appeared to have solved those at times though not at others"

__label__3.0 mckay was a coldweather twoway high school prospect with average tools as is the case with many louisville commits his asking price was high he got to campus and took such an immediate step forward that he was invited to play for college team usa after just his freshman year his tools steadily progressed and entering his draft spring mckay was showing effortless grade raw power and aboveaverage raw stuff on the mound on draft day we think a slight majority of teams preferred mckay as a hitter the two of us were split but every mlb team had him as a first round talent both ways so it seemed inevitable that he would be the rare player who would get a chance to do both in pro ball so his team could at least have time to determine which path was the right one if he couldnt do both that openminded approach has driven how tampa bay has developed mckay in  his offense was fine  he was unlucky by advanced and trackman metrics  while he really broke out as a pitcher regularly showing all the best stuff that he had only flashed in college mckay leaned on a lowtomids fastball and didnt have trouble navigating lineups because of his above average to plus command of the pitch a plusflashing curveball is his best secondary offering but his cutter and changeup are both aboveaverage giving him no  or  starter upside and hes not a long way off from reaching it shohei ohtanis usage is the only precedent for how mckay might be handled a standout playoff rotationcaliber starter and dh given how baseball is valuing first basedh players there appears to be much more value on the mound for mckay but theres still a real chance he turns into something like a  wrc hitter who could make a club just on the merits of his hitting and fielding ability as a first baseman and scouts have always raved about his makeup and work ethic the most exciting scenario would be if tampa bay paired him with a twoway righty tanner dodson was a high pick in  that will play both ways and pull the gambit joe maddon has tried before rotating righty and lefty pitchers between the mound and a spot in the field based on the matchups it could be an effective strategy on its own while enabling roster flexibility in other areas and it saves matchup relievers until later in the game of course nobody wants the rays to get too cute and spoil what might just be a traditional midrotation profile

__label__1.0 beck was premium prospect out of a socal high school reportedly turning down over  million to go to stanford as he had long wanted to do there beck had various injury issues and his stuff and command didnt progress as many had hoped but he still showed glimpses of his upside from high school in instructional league he ran his fastball up to  mph which didnt happen often in college and his signature hammer curveball flashed plus once again beck is still in the nether region of starter vs reliever given his uneven track record and command that doesnt consistently flash average but his power stuff will play in any role if he can continue showing what he did in instructional league
__label__1.0 mariñez was a notable infield prospect early in his career due to his hands actions arm strength and frame but he never developed even viable upperlevel feel for hitting so he was moved to the mound late in  he barely threw at an affiliate and so he was most widely seen during instructional league where he was a fluid and easy  with good nascent secondary stuff he had a strong  in the midminors and in our opinion is a potential rule  target if oakland thinks hes still too green to put on the man
__label__2.0 phillips walked a minuscule  of opposing lowa hitters in  and did so as a yearold just a few years removed from new jersey high school ball his fastball approaches the plate at an awkward angle enabling it to play in the strike zone despite fringe velocity he throws a lot of rightonright changeups  its his best put away offering and also helps induce grounders due to its sink while phillips slurvy breaking ball is generic he typically locates it off the plate where it cant get hammered on stuff phillips looks like a backend starter but the ultraefficient strike throwing could mean he has sneaky ceiling even if the value comes from innings volume

__label__1.0 laras delivery evokes a tesla coil mids lightning shoots out of this seemingly unstable thing a delivery unlike any other in baseball so funky and violent is laras crossbody sidearm style of throwing that its rare for any two consecutive deliveries of his to look even kind of the same he only projects in relief and a lack of control may eventually be his complete undoing as a prospect but lara also has a premium threepitch mix on par with modern highleverage relievers his arm slot alone makes him a tough atbat for righties and his changeup stifles lefties he may have three functionally plus pitches at peak and be a dynamic bullpen stopper or he may have strikethrowing issues that make him unrosterable this is one of the more volatile relief prospects in the minors
__label__2.0 medina was up to  mph as an yearold amateur eventually going unsigned on july nd due in part to  command then he hit  mph as an amateur with improved feel which is when the yankee scooped him up for  he was the highest variance player on last years version of this list and is once again the pure stuff hasnt change and its top of the line a  mph heater that has hit  mph a power curveball thats anywhere from  to  depending on the day and a changeup that flashes  or  at its best his command is now a  that we project to be a  but hes still a teenager so theres a chance that things click for him and he finds  command and  control which would be the minimum to stick as a starter with this kind of stuff medinas issues arent physical  his delivery is fine and his arm stroke is clean instead the problem appears to be mostly mental hell throw well in the bullpen only to have things will snowball for him in game situations one source described his issues as stemming from a need for greater mental maturity and to not be so hard on himself which are exactly the kinds of traits that come with general social maturity that said this sort of stuff rarely comes with starter command so medina is probably either a highwire act reliever with bonkers stuff or a starter with the stuff ratcheted down a bit similar to what touki toussaint has done the last couple seasons
__label__3.0 allen is a better athlete than one would likely surmise if they were just looking at him in the uniform his fastpaced delivery is hard for hitters with a big leg kick to properly time the first time through the order and once theyve gotten a feel for his fastball allen pulls the string on his sinking plus changeup his strikethrowing has improved from slightly belowaverage to slightly above over the last  months or so and allen now comfortably projects as a no  starter

lawsons velocity has climbed and his breaking ball which was in the  mph range in high school now has more power to it and rests in the mids he found a better changeup in  quelling most concerns about him eventually winding up in the bullpen his delivery isnt as fluid as it was in high school but while lawson doesnt have pinpoint touchandfeel command his fastball lives in the zone and he throws enough strikes to start hes enduring a walk uptick at doublea early in  but his rate of strikes  is the same as last year so the walk totals are probably going to regress to lawsons career mean he projects as a no  starter or a valuable reliever if hes pushed to the bullpen by the depth of talent on the rest of san diegos staff"

__label__3.0 we dont typically project such a strong postdraft uptick in velocity for a college starter but gilbert was worked so hard during his junior year at stetson that we believe the velo he showed last year was beneath what well see with a more regimented workload as a pro he was sitting  as a rising sophomore on cape cod but often sat  and sometimes  throughout his starts the following spring while we anticipate a rebound  and gilbert has been  in bullpens and simulated environments this spring  college starters often experience a slight downturn in velo because theyre being asked to go every fifth day for five months instead of once a week for three and a half while theres a wide array of potential outcomes for gilberts fastball his command breaking ball quality prototypical frame and mechanical consistency have been stable he at least profiles as a quickmoving backend starter but could be a midrotation arm if the velo comes back and hes a good bet to be on our midyear top  update

"__label__3.0 we still know very little about pearson compared to most yearold pitching prospects he popped up seemingly out of nowhere as a sophomore at a lesser florida junior college but quickly entered the first round discussion when juco ball kicked off in january of  as the draft approached pearson was showing better secondary stuff in games and bumping  mph in bullpen sessions for scouts he forced his way up draft boards even though teams had little history with him and some were skeptical of the new velocity or concerned it would lead to injury 
pearson made seven short but dominant appearances in the northwest league during the summer and was poised to begin  at hia dunedin an aggressive assignment but he suffered an intercostal strain and began the season on the dl in his final extended spring rehab start he was sitting  and touching  with the fastball he finally toed a florida state league rubber that week and lasted  innings before a comebacker struck his wrist and forearm and fractured his ulna the injury ended his regular season after just five outs 
after rest and some rehab during instructs pearson went to arizona for the fall league his stuff was electric there his fastball always sitting  and cresting  mph often he threw a  mph fastball and a  mph slider during the fall stars game and he was able to dump his uppers curveball in for strikes throughout his sixweek tenure though he threw no changeups pearson was also horribly wild at times its fair to conclude that rust was to blame for his occasional wildness but because the pro side of the industry has seen so little of pearson its impossible to know for sure 
theres a strong possibility that he just ends up in the bullpen but if he does and he breathes oneinning fire like he did during fall stars he basically has aroldis chapmans stuff though perhaps not the same extension or approach angle provided he stays healthy pearsons future is bright albeit unclear hes likely to be handled with care for a while in order to keep him healthy and manage his workload after what was essentially a lost  but given the wide variance and top shelf stuff there is still frontline starter potential"
__label__3.0 cabrera has prototypical size and arm strength but is almost exactly the same player we wrote up last offseason he still has issues locating his heater and with his breaking balls consistency though it flashes plus because he has two unteachable skills in his elite velocity and ability to spin cabrera has significant upside if he improves the remaining aspects of his craft hes not likely to fully actualize but it is possible theres a greater chance that some things improve and enable cabrera to be a no  or  starter or lateinning reliever

__label__1.0 krook has one of the best  mph fastballs in the minors due to its dramatic sinking movement which makes it capable of missing bats despite belowaverage velocity his arm angle and the shape of his fastball create a pitch that looks very similar to zach brittons sinker but with much less zip though the giants who traded him to tampa as part of the evan longoria deal tried to develop krook as a starter early in his career a combination of injury concern bad delivery flunked physical coming out of high school tj in college and lack of control made it likely that hed eventually move to the bullpen and that transition  or at least to a role where krook throws a number of innings typical of a reliever he may be a candidate to open but we dont know for sure  is underway krook used to live in the lowtomids and his drop in velocity is perhaps a red flag considering his medical history but it plays even at this velocity and so do his two breaking balls which benefit from the deceptive ugliness of his delivery
__label__2.0 an athletic outwardly competitive twoway high schooler woods richardson would also have been a prospect as a powerhitting third baseman were he not so good on the mound his vertically oriented release point makes it hard for him to work his fastball east and west and several teams had him evaluated as a future reliever before the draft because they saw a lack of fastball command but this vertical release also enables him to effectively change hitters eye level by pairing fastballs up with breaking balls down and he has a plus breaking ball woods richardson works so quickly that it often makes hitters uncomfortable though scouts love it hes also shown some nascent changeup feel but it will be hard to turn the cambio over consistently from his arm slot though he was one of the  drafts youngest prospects his frame is pretty mature so were not rounding up on the fastball even though hes still a teenager his reasonable floor is that of a highleverage or multiinning reliever a role that would seem to suit his fiery onmound presence but if a third impact pitch develops he could be a midrotation starter
"__label__3.0 the summer before his senior year of high school luzardo looked like a relatively unprojectable pitchability lefty albeit an advanced one his fastball was only in the  range at area codes though his changeup and curveball were each aboveaverage he did not throw during the fall and instead devoted more time to working out the following spring with a new physique luzardos stuff was way up across the board his fastball now sitting comfortably in the mids touching  four starts into his senior season luzardo tore his ucl and need tommy john 
after most of the first three rounds of the  draft had come and gone it seemed as though luzardo might end up at the university of miami four outings including the one during which he broke was not enough time for many teams to have highlevel decision makers in to see him and take him early but the nationals who have a history of drafting pitchers who have fallen due to injury called his name and signed him for  million a bonus equivalent to an early second rounder luzardo rehabbed as a national and continued to strengthen his body when he returned the following summer his stuff had completely returned he made just three starts for the gcl nats before he was traded to oakland as part of the sean doolittleryan madson deal 
he has quickly climbed oaklands minor league ladder and reached triplea at age  in  those crafty pitchability traits from high school are still extant luzardo will vary the shape of his breaking ball  he can throw it for strikes to get ahead of hitters he back foot it to righties  and he uses his changeup against lefties and righties his delivery is a bit violent but it doesnt inhibit his command and luzardos musculature seems better able to deal with the effort than it was when he was in high school his fastball which has been up to  in his big league appearances this spring may not play like a mids heater because he is undersized and a shortstrider but he locates it well enough to avoid getting hurt 
he has midrotation upside and is abnormally polished we may see him in oakland this year"

scouts thought he had a chance to reach oakland by years end and a surprisingly competitive oakland club would have been motivated to move him quickly puk has recently begun throwing bullpens and should be going fulltilt later in the spring he appeared to have no  or  starter upside before his injury"

__label__1.0 santos is pretty singular in the context of lowlevel pro ball but actually shares traits with a cluster of recent high school pitching prospects who unexpectedly grew into premium stuff just  when the season started santos dominated older gcl hitters for two months he walked just four batters in eleven starts and struck out more than a batter per inning despite often sitting just  if he develops velocity santos could be very good very quickly because he can do everything else he has a plusflashing splitaction changeup and can locate an average slider his fastball moves and he can run it back onto his gloveside corner or just off the plate to his arm side but its hard to say if santos will grow into more fastball because his frame is already maxed out the scouting reports of rising high school seniors jesus luzardo and forrest whitley read an awful lot like that before each of them altered their training and conditioning and experienced a huge jump in velocity whether santos is a candidate for reverse projection in this way is hard to say but its fair to assume some growth on the fastball through sheer physical maturity if santos retains his command at greater velocities hes going to move quickly and could be a monster if the velo doesnt come hell have to keep proving year after year that he can gets guys out with  velo
__label__1.0 hernandez is a physical longarmed righty who throws really hard and is rather deceptive his fastball gets some help from extension but it enters the zone at a hittable angle and hernandez is fly ball prone he also has a terse uppers slider that induces weak contact more than it misses bats because it lacks length it could be a weapon in on the hands of lefties though and hernandez has shown some feel for creating vertical action with it though really onlt to his arm side hes a relief prospect
__label__2.0 line up all the teenage arms on the planet and few of them have stuff as hellacious as vargas who had moments of being a dominant force of nature in last years azl at times vargas would sit  at others his fastball would crest  and hed break off the occasional plusplus breaking ball he also has long stretches where hes wild erratic and visibly flustered on the mound there’s much to be desired from a poisemoundpresence standpoint here but that’s okay for now considering his age he has a deep plunging arm action similar to that of domingo german and jonathan loaisiga who have each had injury issues as has vargas and he might end up a reliever but we currently have him evaluated the way we would a late first round arm
__label__3.0 oaklands selection of kyler murray seems to have been the catalyst for liberatores draft day slide he was arguably the best high school pitcher in the class evaluated heavily early on by the giants who picked second before settling into the  range by june when murray was selected teams picking behind oakland suddenly had access to one more player than they had anticipated it meant travis swaggerty was there for pittsburgh at  which meant grayson rodriguez was there for baltimore at  and so on other teams hadnt considered the possibility that libby would fall to them and either hadnt done a lot of background work or werent comfortable with how he might alter their bonus pool math when liberatore is at his best he throws strikes with  for the first several innings of his starts show you a  curveball a good change and alter the timing of his delivery to toy with hitters he added a slider part way through his junior year and instantly had nascent feel for it at other times hed sit  with scattershot command and get too cute with johnny cueto shenanigans but the frame athleticism arm strength and ability to spin are all ideal and theres immense ceiling here
__label__3.0 cabrera has prototypical size and arm strength but is almost exactly the same player we wrote up last offseason he still has issues locating his heater and with his breaking balls consistency though it flashes plus because he has two unteachable skills in his elite velocity and ability to spin cabrera has significant upside if he improves the remaining aspects of his craft hes not likely to fully actualize but it is possible theres a greater chance that some things improve and enable cabrera to be a no  or  starter or lateinning reliever 
__label__3.0 mckay was a coldweather twoway high school prospect with average tools as is the case with many louisville commits his asking price was high he got to campus and took such an immediate step forward that he was invited to play for college team usa after just his freshman year his tools steadily progressed and entering his draft spring mckay was showing effortless grade raw power and aboveaverage raw stuff on the mound on draft day we think a slight majority of teams preferred mckay as a hitter the two of us were split but every mlb team had him as a first round talent both ways so it seemed inevitable that he would be the rare player who would get a chance to do both in pro ball so his team could at least have time to determine which path was the right one if he couldnt do both that openminded approach has driven how tampa bay has developed mckay in  his offense was fine  he was unlucky by advanced and trackman metrics  while he really broke out as a pitcher regularly showing all the best stuff that he had only flashed in college mckay leaned on a lowtomids fastball and didnt have trouble navigating lineups because of his above average to plus command of the pitch a plusflashing curveball is his best secondary offering but his cutter and changeup are both aboveaverage giving him no  or  starter upside and hes not a long way off from reaching it shohei ohtanis usage is the only precedent for how mckay might be handled a standout playoff rotationcaliber starter and dh given how baseball is valuing first basedh players there appears to be much more value on the mound for mckay but theres still a real chance he turns into something like a  wrc hitter who could make a club just on the merits of his hitting and fielding ability as a first baseman and scouts have always raved about his makeup and work ethic the most exciting scenario would be if tampa bay paired him with a twoway righty tanner dodson was a high pick in  that will play both ways and pull the gambit joe maddon has tried before rotating righty and lefty pitchers between the mound and a spot in the field based on the matchups it could be an effective strategy on its own while enabling roster flexibility in other areas and it saves matchup relievers until later in the game of course nobody wants the rays to get too cute and spoil what might just be a traditional midrotation profile
__label__1.0 the career saves leader at miami garcia tore through the minors and pitched across four levels all the way to triplea in his first full pro season then he blew out during the spring of  and likely wont be back on any mound let alone a big league one until the middle of  a threequarters slinger with mids heat garcia also has a plus slider and we think the movement profile on the fastball mimics his changeup in such a way that the cambio will be serviceable as well he could be a lateinning threepitch reliever assuming his stuff comes back after the surgery
__label__2.0 muller is a big athletic aggressive lefty with a sturdy frame and above average stuff to go with average type command he displayed raw power in high school that some scouts graded as a  so theres likely some real value above what most nl pitchers offer at the plate he had a velocity dip after signing which most seem to think stemmed from heavy usage in high school that appeared to be the case as his velocity was back up this spring after some training at driveline muller isnt traditionally exciting since he doesnt have huge velocity or a crazy athletic and loose delivery but lots of longtime starters have looked like this at this stage in their careers
__label__2.0 even though linares frame hasnt filled out very much since he teenage days his velocity has climbed loose and spindly the lowslot lefty now sports a fastball that sits in the lowtomid s linares uses his curveball to attack both left and righthanded hitters and his lack of changeup development to this point is the chief reason why he may project to the bullpen where he may throw even harder and turn into something resembling felipe vasquez we like lanky athletic pitchers with feel for spin though there are clear things to work on linares is one of those he should spend  at hia

early in pro ball manning had some real trouble with strikethrowing then slowly settled in he has two easy plus pitches in his fastball and curveball but his changeup is almost always below average and his command comes and goes his fastball plays up due to his excellent extension but he gets so much extension that he overstrides and it reduces the amount of feel he has both in his changeup and command if manning can dial down the aggression in his delivery a bit the starter traits should come to the forefront and give the tigers a no  or  starter"
__label__3.0 sanchezs first  start  during which he walked an uncharacteristically high four hitters and spent much of the outing rotating his head and neck about his shoulders and stretching his arm and upper back  was perhaps a harbinger of things to come his season would later end due to multiple injuries after that rough first start his stuff and command were as they usually are he was generating uppers velocity with ease his breaking balls were crisp and his changeups were welllocated and moving he walked just seven hitters in his final seven starts of the year before succumbing to elbow inflammation which ended his regular season in earlyjune sanchez rehabbed in florida in anticipation of an arizona fall league assignment and threw some tune up innings early during the  fall instructional league his stuff intact and ready for arizona then he awoke one morning with soreness in his collarbone after an mri it was determined that sixto would have to shut things down for a bit and head to arizona quite late so he was just shelved for the year sanchez has now missed time to injury in two consecutive seasons in each year he has often been given extended rest between starts and dealt with issues in his neck and collarbone area that isnt ideal and all else being equal wed rather have a pitching prospect without this kind of injury history but all else isnt equal when one lines up sixtos stuff and command both of which are very advanced for a conversion arm so new to pitching against the stuff and command of other minor league pitchers this is one of the most talented pitching prospects on earth one with top of the rotation potential hes still only  so the fact that injuries have diluted his innings output isnt a huge issue yet hopefully he has a healthy robust  and gets back on track to debut in

early in  webbs stuff was down a bit more  and touching  before he got popped for peds and was suspended for  games he returned with the same heater peaking at  and the changeup got better very quickly the command piece is still not always there particularly early in games but at other times webb has armside feel for the change gloveside feel for his slider and and hell run the occasional twoseamer back over the plate its top  stuff with the suspension and injury history rounding the fv down just a bit"

__label__2.0 phillips walked a minuscule  of opposing lowa hitters in  and did so as a yearold just a few years removed from new jersey high school ball his fastball approaches the plate at an awkward angle enabling it to play in the strike zone despite fringe velocity he throws a lot of rightonright changeups  its his best put away offering and also helps induce grounders due to its sink while phillips slurvy breaking ball is generic he typically locates it off the plate where it cant get hammered on stuff phillips looks like a backend starter but the ultraefficient strike throwing could mean he has sneaky ceiling even if the value comes from innings volume
__label__1.0 tillo is a recent velo spike guy who has been up to  this spring but he was often into the mids last summer both of his secondaries are capable of missing bats but he has to locate his slider for that pitch to be effective and his general feel for the craft is lacking so that may never happen consistently despite his long arm action tillo also has a diving changeup that hitters will swing over the top of or make awkward contact with its no  starter stuff but we think tillos control means hell likely move to the bullpen eventually
__label__3.0 rodriguez was an earlyvelo guy in his draft class notable as an underclassman because of his prodigious size and arm strength then he plateaued a bit and was sitting mostly  in short stints on the showcase circuit leading into his draft year but right out of the gate the next spring rodriguez began running his heater up to  and was instantly in the first round conversation as soon as teams got in to watch him dominate pretty weak competition in nacogdoches tx rodriguez fits the mold of a first round prep righty a player demographic increasingly perceived as risky on draft day he has a big frame that remains relatively projectable has big velocity and a great breaking ball and shows other starter traits often enough that he projects as part of a rotation some scouts thought the changeup and command would progress but not be weapons of their own they had rodriguez toward the back of the first round others thought the curveball and slider both flashed plus and didnt care about the change or thought his delivery only needed small tweaks those teams thought he could become a no  or  starter

"__label__2.0 some teams moved off of lawson when he had some injury issues as a high school senior but the padres found themselves flush with pool money after taking underslot prospects late in the first round hudson potts and eric lauer which enabled them to give lawson  million in the second round  million above slot he has yet to spend any time on the il as a pro 
lawsons velocity has climbed and his breaking ball which was in the  mph range in high school now has more power to it and rests in the mids he found a better changeup in  quelling most concerns about him eventually winding up in the bullpen his delivery isnt as fluid as it was in high school but while lawson doesnt have pinpoint touchandfeel command his fastball lives in the zone and he throws enough strikes to start hes enduring a walk uptick at doublea early in  but his rate of strikes  is the same as last year so the walk totals are probably going to regress to lawsons career mean he projects as a no  starter or a valuable reliever if hes pushed to the bullpen by the depth of talent on the rest of san diegos staff"
__label__3.0 wilson is a scout favorite as an aggressive bulldog who relies on spotting his fastball in all quadrants of the zone with the velocity movement and command all grading above average on his various fastballs his slider will flash  in ideal situations but plays closer to fringe average regularly while his changeup also flashes  at times and is better than the slider most games wilson fits in todays game because the concerns around him involve turning over the lineup and using his third pitch but he normally has a plus fastball above average command plus plus makeup and at least one average to above offspeed pitch so he could be a great  inning reliever who works in various roles theres still a chance he could be a traditional starter but the braves pitching depth likely dictates a hybrid role in the short term

since being drafted rolison has worked more frequently with all three of his pitches throwing  of his pitches for strikes and his velocity has remained in the  range even as he throws every fifth day mostly rather than once a week he could end up with three aboveaverage pitches and be a no  or no  starter"

__label__2.0 szapucki is another player on this list who stood out early in his prep career and ranked near the top of his class as a prep sophomore because he could get into the lows with a highspin breaking ball from a tough arm slot he slipped to the fifth round in his draft year as some scouts were worried his crossfire delivery was both an injury risk and the underlying reason for his command issues and would be tough to correct the injury concerns were mostly accurate as szapucki had shoulder soreness that led into tommy john surgery in july  hes back on the mound and every indication is that hell be able to return to his prior form when he dominated the minor leagues to the tune of  strikeouts to  walks over  appearances before his arm trouble szapucki gets into the mids with a plus curveball and flashes an average changeup from that tough slot and knows how to use his stuff to elicit chase swings even though his control is average at best the mets have no plans to develop him in the bullpen in the shortterm but it seems very possible that his durability and style of pitching may fit best in a josh hadertype role
__label__3.0 drafted and unsigned by the pirates as a  first rounder lodolo took a bit of a circuitous route to the top of the  class he had iffy freshman and sophomore years but flashed a tantalizing blend of stuff and feel at times keeping him in the first round mix despite inconsistent performance everything clicked for him during an earlyseason college tournament in houston where lodolo worked in the mids with a plus breaking ball and changeup he generally sits  but he is lanky foot so it plays up a bit due to extension hes more apt to throw his curveball for strikes rather than bury it in the dirt for swings and misses but he showed better grasp of the latter late in the year while lodlo will sometimes go entire outings without throwing many changeups there have been stretches where its his best pitch his frame is ideal his delivery elegant and repeatable the stuff isnt dominant but some teams are still projecting on it because of how big and lean lodolos frame is and they think it might be eventually

garcia is a very good athlete which is what allows him to repeat his delivery throw so many strikes and have at least average command despite a delivery that has crossfire recoil and effort at release were hesitant to knock garcias delivery simply because its unusual or due to his size because his performance at this age has also been remarkable he has a rising fastball with which he operates up in the zone and he knows exactly how to use his high spin curveball which has been over  rpm at times a welllocated fastball up a highspin curveball down and a changeup down to keep hitters honest is a good combo and garcia knows how to use them in sequence to set up hitters theres some question about his approach being too simplistic to work at the big league level but again we would bet on garcia figuring out how to make it work hell open  in doublea and could be good enough to crack the bombers bullpen late in the season"

pearson made seven short but dominant appearances in the northwest league during the summer and was poised to begin  at hia dunedin an aggressive assignment but he suffered an intercostal strain and began the season on the dl in his final extended spring rehab start he was sitting  and touching  with the fastball he finally toed a florida state league rubber that week and lasted  innings before a comebacker struck his wrist and forearm and fractured his ulna the injury ended his regular season after just five outs 
after rest and some rehab during instructs pearson went to arizona for the fall league his stuff was electric there his fastball always sitting  and cresting  mph often he threw a  mph fastball and a  mph slider during the fall stars game and he was able to dump his uppers curveball in for strikes throughout his sixweek tenure though he threw no changeups pearson was also horribly wild at times its fair to conclude that rust was to blame for his occasional wildness but because the pro side of the industry has seen so little of pearson its impossible to know for sure 
theres a strong possibility that he just ends up in the bullpen but if he does and he breathes oneinning fire like he did during fall stars he basically has aroldis chapmans stuff though perhaps not the same extension or approach angle provided he stays healthy pearsons future is bright albeit unclear hes likely to be handled with care for a while in order to keep him healthy and manage his workload after what was essentially a lost  but given the wide variance and top shelf stuff there is still frontline starter potential"

though hes not built like most prep prospects weathers is remarkably athletic and was a dynamite high school basketball player his stuff waxed and waned during his senior spring but when it was good he had arguably the best present threepitch mix and pitch usage in the  prep pitching class hes a shortstrider so the fastball is going to play down a bit due to poor extension but otherwise he projects as a midrotation arm due to the quality of his secondaries and potentially a quickmoving one after  strong innings at lowa to start the year weathers was shut down with a dead arm"

the issue here is that pardinho is listed at foot and  pounds and isnt much bigger than that right now though he has a sturdy build yearold pitchers need to have big velocity or projection to add velocity to be top prospects since they generally start losing velocity in their mids that innate velocity or projection for it offers some margin for error there are exceptions to this benchmark like zack greinke cases where a pitcher has been a pitchability type with above average stuff from his teenage days all the way into a big league career but those instances are very rare pardinho will sit  and hit  mph early in outing and settle around  later his curveball flashed above average as an amateur and he mixed in a slider that lagged behind but those two pitches are both average to above now theyre different pitches but still can run together at times common for a younger pitcher parindhos changeup is his fourth pitch now and its around average but he separated himself with above average command projection which helped him post gaudy numbers in his pro debut in the appalachian league at

__label__1.0 dibrell looked like a second round talent at times in college but his velocity and command varied pretty wildly during his draft year at kennesaw state and he fell to the fourth round in his first pro season dibrell though somewhat old for the league tied for the sally league lead in strikeouts his velocity held in the lows all year and his combination of mechanical deception and four viable pitches projects to fit in the back of a rotation
__label__3.0 wilson is a scout favorite as an aggressive bulldog who relies on spotting his fastball in all quadrants of the zone with the velocity movement and command all grading above average on his various fastballs his slider will flash  in ideal situations but plays closer to fringe average regularly while his changeup also flashes  at times and is better than the slider most games wilson fits in todays game because the concerns around him involve turning over the lineup and using his third pitch but he normally has a plus fastball above average command plus plus makeup and at least one average to above offspeed pitch so he could be a great  inning reliever who works in various roles theres still a chance he could be a traditional starter but the braves pitching depth likely dictates a hybrid role in the short term
__label__2.0 manoah is a bigbodied late bloomer from south florida who wasnt a top notch recruit but developed into an elite prospect in his sophomore year in morgantown he took a softer foot  body and got in better shape for the spring and it took a high effort relief type into a possible workhorse midrotation starter manoah still stands out for his fastballslider combo and the changeup and command are around average so it may be more of a power multiinning arm than a true inning starter but his two best features are also trackman friendly this means that progressive clubs see a quickmoving arm with lance mccullerstype qualities and traditional ones see someone they could mold into a power starter
"__label__3.0 we still know very little about pearson compared to most yearold pitching prospects he popped up seemingly out of nowhere as a sophomore at a lesser florida junior college but quickly entered the first round discussion when juco ball kicked off in january of  as the draft approached pearson was showing better secondary stuff in games and bumping  mph in bullpen sessions for scouts he forced his way up draft boards even though teams had little history with him and some were skeptical of the new velocity or concerned it would lead to injury 
pearson made seven short but dominant appearances in the northwest league during the summer and was poised to begin  at hia dunedin an aggressive assignment but he suffered an intercostal strain and began the season on the dl in his final extended spring rehab start he was sitting  and touching  with the fastball he finally toed a florida state league rubber that week and lasted  innings before a comebacker struck his wrist and forearm and fractured his ulna the injury ended his regular season after just five outs 
after rest and some rehab during instructs pearson went to arizona for the fall league his stuff was electric there his fastball always sitting  and cresting  mph often he threw a  mph fastball and a  mph slider during the fall stars game and he was able to dump his uppers curveball in for strikes throughout his sixweek tenure though he threw no changeups pearson was also horribly wild at times its fair to conclude that rust was to blame for his occasional wildness but because the pro side of the industry has seen so little of pearson its impossible to know for sure 
theres a strong possibility that he just ends up in the bullpen but if he does and he breathes oneinning fire like he did during fall stars he basically has aroldis chapmans stuff though perhaps not the same extension or approach angle provided he stays healthy pearsons future is bright albeit unclear hes likely to be handled with care for a while in order to keep him healthy and manage his workload after what was essentially a lost  but given the wide variance and top shelf stuff there is still frontline starter potential"

he has quickly climbed oaklands minor league ladder and reached triplea at age  in  those crafty pitchability traits from high school are still extant luzardo will vary the shape of his breaking ball  he can throw it for strikes to get ahead of hitters he back foot it to righties  and he uses his changeup against lefties and righties his delivery is a bit violent but it doesnt inhibit his command and luzardos musculature seems better able to deal with the effort than it was when he was in high school his fastball which has been up to  in his big league appearances this spring may not play like a mids heater because he is undersized and a shortstrider but he locates it well enough to avoid getting hurt

__label__1.0 mora often struggled to throw strikes after he was sent from extended spring training to vermont and he likely fits in relief longterm due to command mora has a wellbalanced lower half through release but he lacks tactile feel for release his upper body rotates in unison like a tiltawhirl and his low s arm slot generates mediocre angle on his fastball but he throws pretty hard in the  range and will flash an aboveaverage slider hes only ever thrown from the stretch in erics looks reinforcing our relief projection but he may end up as a good threepitch one

burkes fastball plays up because he gets way down the mound and generates a lot of backspin on the ball creating perceived rise changeup development seemed to occur in  as the pitch was much different last year  mph at times with cut than it was in   mph and it’s fair to speculate that something like a grip change took place here burke has two breaking balls that are both about average though he uses the curveball pretty sparingly gloveside command of his cutterslider makes him tough on righties one source considers burkes delivery fairly easy to time because of its pacing so maybe we need to see more curveballs as a way of disrupting timing he projects as a no  or  starter"

garcia is a very good athlete which is what allows him to repeat his delivery throw so many strikes and have at least average command despite a delivery that has crossfire recoil and effort at release were hesitant to knock garcias delivery simply because its unusual or due to his size because his performance at this age has also been remarkable he has a rising fastball with which he operates up in the zone and he knows exactly how to use his high spin curveball which has been over  rpm at times a welllocated fastball up a highspin curveball down and a changeup down to keep hitters honest is a good combo and garcia knows how to use them in sequence to set up hitters theres some question about his approach being too simplistic to work at the big league level but again we would bet on garcia figuring out how to make it work hell open  in doublea and could be good enough to crack the bombers bullpen late in the season"

__label__3.0 sanchezs first  start  during which he walked an uncharacteristically high four hitters and spent much of the outing rotating his head and neck about his shoulders and stretching his arm and upper back  was perhaps a harbinger of things to come his season would later end due to multiple injuries after that rough first start his stuff and command were as they usually are he was generating uppers velocity with ease his breaking balls were crisp and his changeups were welllocated and moving he walked just seven hitters in his final seven starts of the year before succumbing to elbow inflammation which ended his regular season in earlyjune sanchez rehabbed in florida in anticipation of an arizona fall league assignment and threw some tune up innings early during the  fall instructional league his stuff intact and ready for arizona then he awoke one morning with soreness in his collarbone after an mri it was determined that sixto would have to shut things down for a bit and head to arizona quite late so he was just shelved for the year sanchez has now missed time to injury in two consecutive seasons in each year he has often been given extended rest between starts and dealt with issues in his neck and collarbone area that isnt ideal and all else being equal wed rather have a pitching prospect without this kind of injury history but all else isnt equal when one lines up sixtos stuff and command both of which are very advanced for a conversion arm so new to pitching against the stuff and command of other minor league pitchers this is one of the most talented pitching prospects on earth one with top of the rotation potential hes still only  so the fact that injuries have diluted his innings output isnt a huge issue yet hopefully he has a healthy robust  and gets back on track to debut in 
__label__1.0 bowlan had an uptick in velocity just before the  draft then his stuf fbacked up after he signed we moved off of him too soon thinking the uptick was an anomally hes come out with a fastball in the  range topping out at  his secondary stuff is average but hes throwing a lot of strikes he had a hot start to  against lowa hitters
__label__1.0 jensen had one of the best arms in the  draft strong and athletic despite being quite small he holds  deep into games and has touched  he can make his fastball ride or tail and he uses it very frequently his secondaries are not as nasty but theyre workable and flash average right now theres a lot pointing to a relief role here because of the size delivery jensens arm action is very long and the reality that two pitches need to develop for him to start but the fastball give him a chance to be a highleverage or multiinning reliever
__label__2.0 wentz has flashed three plus pitches at times but has never done it all in the same outing some thought he was on the verge of doing so in  but he missed huge chunks of the year with oblique and shoulder ailments though they seem minor to us in terms of their longterm effects wentz was  mph with solid average stuff and average command in  and projects to improve when he has a full healthy offseason to regain what he was the year before he is also big and athletic with a smooth delivery and arm action so theres the classic projection youre looking for like muller wentz also has grade raw power to provide offensive value when he reaches the big leagues at its best wentzs fastball was  hitting  mph and his curveball and changeup were plus with multiinnings stretches when his command looked above average which led some scouts to invoke cole hamels things probably land somewhere between the peak of each of his elements and his average  showing
__label__1.0 lefty stood out for team usa with a plus heater above average breaker and solid command though likely only in relief
__label__1.0 peña missed all of  and  due to injury and is a bit behind other yearolds having thrown just  innings above rookie ball thus far but he has three big league offerings and filled up the strike zone in  so he could move quickly if he stays healthy peñas delivery is pretty rough and features quite a bit of violence about his head this along with his lengthy injury history has created worries about his health and hinders his ability to locate with precision as he throws strikes but not always where he wants to perception about peñas health may drive washington to move him quickly so he can reach the majors before he breaks again his stuff appeared close to ready last year as he worked in the mids with armside movement that pairs well with his power and a mids changeup while his lower arm slot enables his slider to play against righties he started last year but we like him as a threepitch middle relief prospect
__label__3.0 wilson is a scout favorite as an aggressive bulldog who relies on spotting his fastball in all quadrants of the zone with the velocity movement and command all grading above average on his various fastballs his slider will flash  in ideal situations but plays closer to fringe average regularly while his changeup also flashes  at times and is better than the slider most games wilson fits in todays game because the concerns around him involve turning over the lineup and using his third pitch but he normally has a plus fastball above average command plus plus makeup and at least one average to above offspeed pitch so he could be a great  inning reliever who works in various roles theres still a chance he could be a traditional starter but the braves pitching depth likely dictates a hybrid role in the short term
__label__3.0 we dont typically project such a strong postdraft uptick in velocity for a college starter but gilbert was worked so hard during his junior year at stetson that we believe the velo he showed last year was beneath what well see with a more regimented workload as a pro he was sitting  as a rising sophomore on cape cod but often sat  and sometimes  throughout his starts the following spring while we anticipate a rebound  and gilbert has been  in bullpens and simulated environments this spring  college starters often experience a slight downturn in velo because theyre being asked to go every fifth day for five months instead of once a week for three and a half while theres a wide array of potential outcomes for gilberts fastball his command breaking ball quality prototypical frame and mechanical consistency have been stable he at least profiles as a quickmoving backend starter but could be a midrotation arm if the velo comes back and hes a good bet to be on our midyear top  update
__label__1.0 german was a solid middleround college pitching prospect going into the  draft with most clubs treating him as a thth round talent who could possibly be a target for the thth rounds and a  bonus as cheap senior signs fillin the latter stages of the top  rounds then german dominicanborn and whose name is pronounced like the european country had one of the latest predraft velo spikes possible suddenly hitting  mph during the atlantic sun conference tournament in his final college game just two weeks before the draft velo is a dime a dozen these days but german had the athleticism and arm action of a starter and had put on about  pounds in the previous  months so some thought this could be coming clubs who had scouts at that start shot him up the board and the yankees jumped to the front of the line to take him in the fourth round the velo spike held in pro ball german sat  and hit  mph in fall instructional league and put on about  additional pounds after signing the upside is a bit limited as his slider and changeup still just flash average at best but the yankees are changing germans slurvy college breaking ball into more of a true slider and pushing him to throw his changeup more so it wouldnt be shocking to see the future pitch grades move north as he continues to mature as a pitcher
__label__3.0 medina is right there with sanchez in the phillies system when it comes to upside he shows three plus pitches at times and may be a better athlete than sanchez so the elements of frontline starter potential are here medina works in the mids early in games with plus life and at his best hell pair it with a changeup with similar action and a slider that can play even better than  when ideally used and located like most young power arms medinas command and velocity degrade in the middle innings as his focus and intensity wane and fatigue starts to set in more advanced hitters can lay off his lively stuff when its more areatype control than mlblevel pitch execution scouts like medinas makeup coachability and athleticism most prefer him to sanchez in this regard and expect him to continue to improve in these areas
