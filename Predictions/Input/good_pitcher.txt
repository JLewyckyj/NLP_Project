Dennis Quaid stands imposing at 6-8, with a bulldog demeanor, strong work ethic, and a 5 pitch mix. Premium on-mound athlete, with elite makeup. Hard worker, infectious charisma. So dominant, he was a quick mover. Electric teenage arm. His fastball sits upper 90s and tops 101, with lots of ride and some arm-side run. It's an easy plus-plus pitch, and he locates it at the top of the zone for whiffs. He has a 2 plane slider that flashes elite. He can pinpoint it on the black for called strikes, throw it below the zone for swings and misses, and even backfoot it to lefties. The curveball is 12-6, high spin, and is often used to steal strikes early in counts due to his impeccable control. He dominates lefties with his cambio, with plus fade and some sink, as well as his cutter which he works in on the hands. He easily repeats his delivery, leading to low walk rates across every level he's faced. As a strong athlete, he fields his position, and can even sneak into games to run late in games. With a clean bill of health, and a strong frame he should continue to fill out, he projects to be sitting atop a World Series rotation as early as the Super-2 deadline passing.
