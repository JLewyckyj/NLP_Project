Humberto Galarraga is a diminuitive Dominican right-hander, but will draw no Pedro comps. The fastball sits upper-80s, and is consistently below average and won't fool hitters. His only other pitch is a forkball that is very hittable. Without a breaking pitch, he is very susceptile to same-handed hitters. He gets bad extension, little drive towards the plate, and is very rotational. Due to his two Tommy Johns, he can't be counted on for innings. There are many concerns about his body, with his large gut likely leading to many of his mechanical issues. At his best, he'll likely wind up as an up-and-down ROOGY who only faces lefties.
